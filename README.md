# climate-api-graph
Python class project to enable users to get synthesized climate information for different locations. 

I focused on getting a personal assistant to request and track down your geolocation, feed that data to a weather API, and have the API output a summary of the weather & climate in your location.

Thomas & Neel focused on informing users about the effects of drought, such as plots that show the frequency and intensity of droughts over time.
